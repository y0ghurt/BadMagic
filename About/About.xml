&lt;b&gt;V1.00&lt;/b&gt;
Magic happens. At least after you install this mod. It's not that good magic you normally hear about though. If you install this mod, be prepared to face, and use, magic so horrible that it is not recorded in any official records. In fact, it's not so much horrible as just plain messed up.

This is not a good mod. If you want to play the game seriously, do not install it. A minimum requirement to even try it is that you laugh at fart jokes. Or hate yourself.
